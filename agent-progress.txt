# Dray Project Progress Log

## Project Summary
Dray is a Golang implementation of a Kafka v4-compatible streaming system with:
- Leaderless/stateless brokers using object-storage WAL + Oxia metadata
- Stream-table duality with Iceberg integration
- Zone-aware routing for multi-AZ deployments

## Task Breakdown
- Total tasks identified: 130
- Categories: infrastructure (10), metadata (12), storage (12), protocol (25),
  produce (8), fetch (8), topics (6), routing (8), groups (25), compaction (10),
  iceberg (8), gc (6), security (5), observability (12), operations (3), testing (16)

## Recommended Architecture
- Go 1.21+ with modules
- twmb/franz-go for Kafka protocol (kmsg package)
- github.com/oxia-db/oxia for metadata
- AWS SDK v2 for S3-compatible storage
- apache/iceberg-go or parquet-go for Iceberg/Parquet

## Implementation Order
Start with project-setup, then follow spec phases:
1. Phase 0: Foundations (config, logging, metrics, interfaces)
2. Phase 1: Oxia integration (client, CAS, notifications, ephemerals)
3. Phase 2: Object store + WAL format
4. Phase 3: Offset index
5. Phase 4: Kafka protocol + core APIs
6. Phase 5-10: Zone routing, groups, compaction, hardening

## Status
- Planning complete: 2025-12-27
- First working agent should start with "project-setup" task
